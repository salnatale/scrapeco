# Spike Research - VC Research Platform

A venture capital research platform focused on analyzing talent flow patterns to predict company success through graph neural networks.

## Core Thesis

Individual employment decisions, when aggregated across thousands of professionals, reveal powerful signals about company health and future success. Our platform builds comprehensive bipartite graphs (Employee ‚Üî Company) and applies advanced graph algorithms to generate investment intelligence.

## Architecture

### Data Layer
- **Neo4j Graph Database**: Stores employee profiles, companies, and career transitions
- **Apache Druid**: Time-series analytics for transition events
- **Bipartite Graph Model**: Employee-Company relationships with weighted edges

### Analysis Layer  
- **PageRank Algorithm**: Identifies influential companies in talent networks
- **BiRank Algorithm**: Balanced ranking for bipartite graphs
- **Talent Flow Metrics**: Inflow/outflow ratios, net talent movement
- **Investment Signals**: Multi-factor scoring based on talent patterns

### Future: GNN Infrastructure
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Deep learning on talent flow graphs
- **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving partner data aggregation
- **Success Prediction**: ML models for investment outcomes
